# Random Array Generation and Merge Sort

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that generates a random array of numbers within a specified range and then sorts that array using the merge sort algorithm.

## Code Explanation

### Random Array Generation

The code starts by using the `random` module to generate a random array of numbers. It allows you to specify the length of the array, as well as the range (minimum and maximum values) for the random numbers.

### Merge Sort Implementation

After generating the random array, the script proceeds to sort it using the merge sort algorithm. The `merge_sort` function is implemented to recursively split the array into smaller subarrays and then merge them back together in sorted order. This sorting process ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order.

## Usage

1. Define the desired length of the random array using the `array_length` variable.

2. Specify the minimum and maximum values for the random numbers using the `min_value` and `max_value` variables.

3. Run the script.

Example:

```python
import random

# Define the length of the array and the range of random numbers
array_length = 10  # You can change this to the desired length
min_value = 1      # Minimum random number
max_value = 100    # Maximum random number

# Generate the array of random numbers
random_array = [random.randint(min_value, max_value) for _ in range(array_length)]

# Print the original random array
print("Original array:", random_array)

# Sort the array using merge sort
merge_sort(random_array)

# Print the sorted array
print("Sorted array:", random_array)
```
