# QR ENCODER
This script allows the user to input the data they want to encode in the QR code. It then uses the qrcode library to create a QR code image and save it to a file named "qrcode.png." You can customize the file name and format (e.g., PNG, SVG) as needed. Make sure to install the qrcode library before running the script

#### QRCode Library Installation
```bash 
pip install qrcode
```
